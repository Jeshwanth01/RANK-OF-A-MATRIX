# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
### Step 2: 
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: 
## Program:
#write a program to find the solution to a system of linear equations [5,-3,-10],[2,2,-3],[-3,-1,5]

#prgram to find the rank of the matrix for the given matrix 
#devoleped by : Jeshwanth r
#registerNumber:2305003003
```python
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[5,-3,-10],[2,2,-3],[-3,-1,5]])
rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print("the rank of the matrix a:",rank)
```
## Output:
![exp 2 sc](https://github.com/Jeshwanth01/RANK-OF-A-MATRIX/assets/145525167/2b8da48c-cc2a-4837-b2d8-dac00d0dba2d)

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
